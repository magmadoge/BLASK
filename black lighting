# Black lighting:The storm 


Zack sparks was walking down in a narrow sidewalk as he found his way to his to the hotel he found a paper with a random writing
in it.The the paper said "BLASK for those with true power and true goodness in them".
"What do these words mean" Zack quietly said 
Zack kept the paper in the pocket of his hoddie thinking it would be usefull later on.As the days past Zack didn't what the paper
was for to he went outside and tried to get rid of it or at least get someone else to get it.But then a lighting struck Zack and 
he fell.All he saw was darkness in the room there was no lighting "where am I" zack said out loud.He coundn't feel his body
he was stuck.Zack tryed to move but he wasn't able to move one finger he tryed and tryed and resulting with fail.
