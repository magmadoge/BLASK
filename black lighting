# Black lighting:The storm 


<p>Zack sparks was walking down in a narrow sidewalk as he found his way to his to the hotel he found a paper with a random writing
in it.The the paper said "BLASK for those with true power and true goodness in them".
"What do these words mean" Zack quietly said 
Zack kept the paper in the pocket of his hoddie thinking it would be usefull later on.As the days past Zack didn't what the paper
was for to he went outside and tried to get rid of it or at least get someone else to get it.But then a lighting struck Zack and 
he fell.All he saw was darkness in the room there was no lighting "where am I" zack said out loud.He coundn't feel his body
he was stuck.Zack tryed to move but he wasn't able to move one finger he tryed and tryed and resulting with fail.The light finnaly
went then zack found him self in a room and other human."Hi my name is Peter Thompson and you are here to have the the abilty to 
join BLASK and you are the first person for me to find".
"I have a lot of abilty one of them is the ability to see the future and I know everyone is going to join the team and their powers"
Peter went on to talk on and on zack didn't listen."Wait what happened" Zack said, zack was able to move again to his joy."Do I 
Really need to explain again" Peter signed."My name is Peter Thompson I am here to say if you want to join the Blask team, I am

and many others.There will be mutiply people who will be joining this team."Peter went on and on explain the team and the future 
team.
"well then what happen to me."Zack then went on and look at him self. His eyes was bright and was filled with the color black that
was overlaping so his eyes looked like black fire.Black lighting streames went out of of his hands "Woah, this fun." Zack kept on
shooting lighting from his hands.</p>
